django-xls-fixtures
==============

This project gives you the ability to use fixtures defined in excel in your tests. We leverage the [Fixture](http://farmdev.com/projects/fixture/) project so that you don't need to use ids to define your relationships and so that all of your dependency management is handled for you.

NOTE: This project is in a non-working ALPHA state. Check back later if you want to use it, or let us know if you want to help make it work :)

Installation
------------

 * Install (you can use our `requirements.txt` if you're using pip):
   * [Fixture](http://farmdev.com/projects/fixture/) 
   * [xlrd[(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd)
   * [django-fixtures](http://bitbucket.org/boothead/django-fixtures)
 * Install django-xls-fixtures using our setup.py (you're using virtualenv, so that's easy, right?).
