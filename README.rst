django-xls-fixtures
===================

This project gives you the ability to use fixtures defined in excel in your tests. We leverage the _Fixture project so that you don't need to use ids to define your relationships and so that all of your dependency management is handled for you.

NOTE: This project is in a non-working ALPHA state. Check back later if you want to use it, or let us know if you want to help make it work :)

Installation
------------

 * Install (you can use our `requirements.txt` if you're using pip):
   * _Fixture 
   * _xlrd
   * _django-fixtures
 * Install django-xls-fixtures (you're using virtualenv, so that's easy, right?).
